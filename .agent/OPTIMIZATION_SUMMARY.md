**Status**: Optimized & Production-Ready

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Created Clear Folder Structure ✅

**Before**: Flat structure with 10+ files in root  
**After**: Organized into 6 logical folders

```
.agent/
├── 📂 business/        ← Business & product docs (3 files)
├── 📂 specs/           ← Page specifications (7 files)
├── 📂 technical/       ← Technical specs (10 files)
├── 📂 design/          ← Design system (2 files)
├── 📂 workflows/       ← Development workflows (1 file)
├── 📂 archive/         ← Completed/old docs (7 files)
├── 📘 INDEX.md         ← Master navigation (NEW!)
├── 📘 README.md        ← Project overview (UPDATED!)
└── 📘 rules.md         ← Coding standards
```

---

### 2. Created Master Index (INDEX.md) ✅

**New file**: `INDEX.md`

**Features**:
- 📖 Quick start guide
- 🗂️ Complete folder structure
- 👥 Role-based navigation (PM, Designer, Frontend, Backend, DevOps)
