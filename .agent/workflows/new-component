Focus: UI consistency, modularity, and clean React patterns.

Step 1: Context Check: Scan package.json for UI libraries (Tailwind, Radix, Shadcn) and existing component patterns.

Step 2: Modular Structure: Create a folder for the component. Include index.ts for clean exports and [ComponentName].tsx for the logic.

Step 3: Implementation:

Use Functional Components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

Ensure all imports are absolute (e.g., @/components/...).

Verify all JSX tags are closed and fragments <> </> are used only when necessary.

Step 4: Best Practices:

Extract complex logic into a custom hook if it exceeds 20 lines.

Add basic Aria labels for accessibility.

Ensure Tailwind classes are sorted (using prettier-plugin-tailwindcss logic).
